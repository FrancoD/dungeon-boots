# Dungeon Boots
***A framework for making grid-based Dungeon Crawler web games using Three js***

## Design Goals

1. Provide a framework to make quick games for jams such as annual The Dungeon Crawlers Jam
	- Be web/JavaScript-based
	- Be easy to modify, easily extendable
2. Satisfy the Definition of a "Dungeon Crawler", aka. DRPG, as outlined here: https://www.dungeoncrawlers.org/definition/
	- First-person exploration
	- Grid-based
		- Instant step movement
		- 90 degree turns
	- Stats
	- At least one character (perferrably allow for a "blob")
	- An end-of-game mechanic, such as a death condition
	- Combat or a similar mechanic for determining outcomes
